**1.3.4**
---
```
- Fixed Moders crossbow not being configurable and using the wrong defaults
```

**1.3.3**
---
```
- Fixed wood bolt triggering the invalid recipe warning
- Fixed a particle mock for arrow feathers not resolving on some versions of valheim
- Rebalance of most boss weapons, and a few outlier non-boss weapons. Recipes are slightly more expensive overall and damage is generall down across the board.
    This primarily brings boss weapons in line with the next tier weapon minus a small bit. The balance change is just to the default config values.
    If you want to keep your weapons more powerful continue using your existing config, defaults will only be applied if you do not have a value set (new or deleted config).
